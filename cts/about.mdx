Hey，I am nazha (那吒) ❤️.

I am a software engineer based in Hangzhou, China. I am currently working at [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/).

Particularly, I am not a native English speaker. I tried to use English since I started contributing to open source. Please accept my sincere apologies if you find my articles difficult to understand.

### Contacts

Feel free to reach me [maoxiaoke@outlook.com](mailto:maoxiaoke@outlook.com).

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xiaokedada), or [Github](https://github.com/maoxiaoke). If you can speak Chinese,
you can add my WeChat (id: nazha_m).

### My Goals

Before I reach 35 years old, I have three goals in mind:

+ Run a company of my own
+ Create a well-known product
+ A year-long travel adventure

I'm writing them down here because I want to keep them in mind..

### My Portrait (That is, my characters)

I like cooking and philosophy. Books are my favorite.

I have stage fright when speaking in public.
